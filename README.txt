I own a couple copies, but instead of ripping the ROM I sourced it from here:
https://romsmania.com/roms/nintendo-64/mario-kart-64-v1-1-233292

I also created a fork of the emulator BizHawk:
https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk

I'll be using my own fork/submodule setup, info can be found on my github page

Here's pre-reqs for using the emulator
